# python-capstone-finance-tracker
Project description:
The project takes input from the terminal, where users can add items to their list and keep track of expenditure for each category

How to test:
We run the file and then add the description, category and amount of each expense, then we process the category string to format it properly to store the items in its respective category( if we enter food, fOOD, they will all fall under the category Food)
Then the user can enter what action they want, like checking the summary, or checking all transactions

Concepts used:
We use fundamental python concepts that were taught in this externship such as strings, loops, dictionaries, functions, exception handling, etc.
